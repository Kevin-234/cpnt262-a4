### Comment
+ It took me forever to figure out why my nav.ejs, header.ejs and footer.ejs wouldn't show up on gallery.ejs file. Solution was I had to change gallery render item string name to different name.

+ I had rough time to connect images and images was keep showing up undefined. 

+ Last thing I struggle was footer.
Whenever I minimize the page it created unknown blank space, but I was just forgot to add justify-content: center and align-items: center; to class wrapper in css.

+ I also enjoy little bit this assignment because the most of Javascript we learnt in cpnt262 was combine and It was neat to understand how backend and front works together.
